# Overview

It is a forum or anonymous community, where adolescents can ask questions related to INTEGRAL SEX EDUCATION. Maybe many teenagers feel "embarrassed" to talk to an adult or their peers. Our application wants to cross the TABÃš towards the Integral Sexual Education, because this is not a forbidden topic, it is not a delicate issue, it is something necessary and it must be informed in all the institutions. We want to provide access to young people and avoid accidents!




## Goals:

 1-That adolescents remove their doubts about comprehensive sexual education.
 2-Guarantee security and anonymity
 3-Educate.




## Specifications
This application has a completely anonymous and personalized registration system. We have a first prototype finished but NOT functional.



### in the future.

We hope our application can be used in classrooms and by teenagers with learning motives.
We also want to incorporate the game factor, reputation points to 'unlock' levels or non-public sections of the app and predetermined answers.



##  What we need now:

Have our functional prototype, and start working in open source.
-Registration and functional profiles.
-Publications and functional comments
